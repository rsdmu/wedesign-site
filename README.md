# WeDesign+ — wedesign.one

Minimal, research‑backed product website for **WeDesign+**, designed for Vercel (Next.js 14 App Router + Tailwind).

## Local development

```bash
pnpm i   # or npm i / yarn
pnpm dev # or npm run dev
```

## Build & deploy
- Push this repo to GitHub.
- Import to **Vercel**. Framework preset **Next.js** (defaults work).
- Set the domain to **wedesign.one**.

## What’s inside
- App Router with a minimalist design language.
- SEO (OpenGraph, sitemap, robots).
- Lightweight lead capture at `/api/lead` (writes to log/console on Vercel).
- Assets: logo, research docs, optional demo video.
- Content grounded in the WeDesign research manuscript and deck.
